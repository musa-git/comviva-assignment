1) Typeahead suggestions enable users to search for known and frequently searched terms. As the user types into the search box, it tries to predict the query based on the characters the user has entered and gives a list of suggestions to complete the query. Typeahead suggestions help the user to articulate their search queries better. It’s not about speeding up the search process but rather about guiding the users and lending them a helping hand in constructing their search query. What data structure would be used for the same and how?

Solution :-
The solution is implemented with Trie data structure. Where it will form the trie nodes graph, each trie node contains the character, map of <Charater,Trie> as children and isEndOfWord.
Each trie node will have maximum 26 children nodes.
